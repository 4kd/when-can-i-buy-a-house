# When can I buy a house?
## A simple one-pager to show users when they can afford an average London deposit and offer advice.

### Requirements

- Accepts user input about their existing savings, regular monthly savings, and interest rates, and returns a results page with helpful links based on the amounts provided.
- If users already have enough money for a deposit, shows a selection of articles covering topics including whether it's a good idea to buy a home, the best places to buy a home, shared ownership schemes, and so on.
- If users don't have enough money but are saving/investing enough, it tells them when they'll be able to afford a deposit, and recommends some ways that could make that sooner (looking at shared ownership, investing money better, saving more through budgeting).
- If users don't have enough money and aren't saving/investing enough, 
- Allows users to share their results on social media.
