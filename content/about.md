I'd moved to London in 2011, and within a few months it had become the only place I'd ever really felt at home. 

At the back of my mind, I'd always assumed that when I reached the point in my life when I wanted to think about buying a house, I'd be able to buy one in London. 

I knew it was expensive, but hey - a couple of years watching my spending should cover that, right?
